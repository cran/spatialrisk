Description: Provides methods for spatial risk calculations, focusing on 
    efficient determination of the sum of observations within a circle of a 
    given radius. These methods are particularly relevant for applications such 
    as insurance, where recent European Commission regulations require the 
    calculation of the maximum insured value of fire risk policies for all 
    buildings that are partly or fully located within a 200 m radius. The 
    underlying problem is described by Church (1974) <doi:10.1007/BF01942293>.
